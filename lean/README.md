This directory holds the security analysis of the zero-knowledge proofs (FAEST v3 VOLE-in-the-head
with QuickSilver, `src/voleith.hpp`) and of the three token protocols built on them: PomFRIT,
Moussaka and Ratatouille. The analysis has three layers, and every result below says which layer it
lives in:

| Layer | What it means |
|---|---|
| **[Lean]** | Machine-checked in `VoleMole/`. No `sorry`, no `axiom`, no `native_decide`; `#print axioms` shows only `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`. Covers the deterministic steps: linear algebra, counting, polynomial degrees, combinatorics, numeric bounds. |
| **[paper]** | A written proof in `docs/`. Covers the probabilistic steps: random-oracle and ideal-cipher arguments, quantum oracle arguments, union bounds, reductions. |
| **[test]** | A Lean model or a deterministic fact checked against the C++ by a test in `tests/` (exhaustively where the domain is small). This is how the Lean models are tied to the code. |

**Partial** means: no end-to-end statement is machine-checked. The Lean results are the
deterministic cores that the paper proofs call. The C++ is tested against the Lean models, never
proved equal to them, and constant-time behaviour and side channels are out of scope.

## Building and checking

```sh
cd lean
lake exe cache get     # prebuilt Mathlib
lake build             # the whole library; must finish with no warnings
lake env lean VoleMole/Arith/UOV.lean    # check a single file
```

The C++ side of the cross-checks runs with the normal test suite:

```sh
ninja -C build && meson test -C build    # includes `lean-models`
```

## The results

### 1. Proof of knowledge (classical) — `docs/extraction/`

**Statement.** For every classical prover, the proof system is a *straight-line* proof of
knowledge for each of the repo's five relations: an extractor that only reads the prover's oracle
queries (no rewinding, no programming) outputs a valid witness whenever the verifier accepts, except
with probability

    ε_ext = Q·max(d,1)·2⁻¹²⁸ + q₁·ε_KOS + q₂·(ε_QS + 2⁻¹²⁸) + q_c·2⁻⁴⁴⁸ + ε_bind + ε_dead + (q²+q)·2⁻²⁵⁶

which is about 2⁻⁶⁰·⁸ at q = 2⁶⁴ queries. Model: SHAKE as random oracles, AES-128 as an ideal
cipher.

**Proof structure.** `docs/extraction/README.md` assembles it from these lemmas:

| Lemma | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | All hash domains are disjoint; AES inputs of different roles never collide | [paper] + [Lean] `Seed/Commitments.lean` |
| L1 | Committed data (commitment preimages, leaf keys) is well defined and binding | [paper] |
| L2 | A leaf the prover cannot open is always the hidden one | [paper] |
| L3 | KOS consistency check forces affine VOLE correlations (ε_KOS ≈ 2⁻¹⁵⁴) | [paper] + [Lean] `Seed/KOS.lean` + [test] |
| L4 | QuickSilver with challenge-dependent constraints: either the constraints hold or few challenges accept | [paper] + [Lean] `Seed/QuickSilver.lean` + [test] |
| L5 | A tree whose challenge block varies holds the witness (Claim 4) | [Lean] `SeedExtraction.lean` |
| L6 | Per-chain case analysis: extract, or accept at most max(d,1) challenges | [Lean] `SeedExtraction.lean` |
| L7 | Arithmetization soundness: satisfied constraints imply the relation | [paper] `L7-uov.md`, `L7-keccak.md` + [test]; Lean in progress (§6) |

Along the way the analysis corrected the sketch's definition of an "alive" leaf (the original
admitted an attack with probability about τ·q₂·2⁻¹²⁸) and found that bad-challenge terms must be
charged per H₂¹/H₂² query, not per H₂³ query.

### 2. Simulation-extractability (classical) — `docs/extraction/L8-*.md`

**Statement.** Strong simulation-extractability: extraction still works when the prover also sees
simulated proofs, for any accepting proof that differs from all simulated ones. [paper] +
[Lean] `Seed/SimExt.lean`. No malleability attack was found.

### 3. Zero knowledge — `docs/zk.md`, `docs/zk-qrom.md`

**Finding (on `main`): the proofs are not zero-knowledge.** The free-XOR label offset of FAEST's
CRT masks equals the first 128 witness bits (up to a public value). A verifier who knows those bits
learns the masks. In PomFRIT the Issuer knows them, so it can link redemptions to issuances:
blindness fails.

**Fix:** derive the labels from dedicated VOLE rows (branch `voleith-label-rows`, faest-arch-opt
patch 0005, +256 bytes per proof).

**Statement (with the fix).** Adaptive, multi-proof, statistical-in-the-witness zero knowledge in
the classical ROM [paper] + [Lean] `ZK/`. Against quantum distinguishers [paper], with a bound of
about 2⁻¹⁹ at 2³⁰ queries and 2³⁰ proofs. The dominant term, Q_P·√(q/2¹²⁸), is the standard
adaptive-reprogramming loss and has no known matching attack. A 128-bit `rho` does admit a real
multi-target Grover attack around 2⁵⁰ queries. Both are removed by a 256-bit `rho` and a salt in
chal1/chal2 (recommended, not implemented).

The analysis also found a gap in the FAEST v3 specification's own ZK proof (between games G8 and
G9).

### 4. Quantum adversaries (QROM + quantum ideal cipher) — `docs/extraction/Q1…Q7`

| Doc | Result | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Key-level compressed oracle for AES as a quantum ideal cipher; online extraction of leaf keys | [paper] + [Lean] `Seed/QuantumCipher.lean` |
| Q2 | Straight-line extraction for quantum provers; leading term ≈ 200·q²·2⁻¹²⁸ (Grover-inherent) | [paper] + [Lean] `Seed/QROM.lean` |
| Q3 | Comparison of AES models; the sketch's "AES-CTR as random oracle" model is unfaithful | [paper] |
| Q4 | Efficient simulation of the quantum ideal cipher (within 2⁻¹⁷²), so the extractor is efficient | [paper] + [Lean] `Seed/CipherSim.lean` |
| Q5 | Simulation-extractability in the QROM (superseded numerically by Q6/Q7) | [paper] + [Lean] `Seed/QSimExt.lean` |
| Q6 | Binding of AES leaf commitments for all q; tightness of key-level techniques | [paper] + [Lean] `Seed/CipherBinding.lean` |
| Q7 | Extraction from many proofs at once; quantum versions of the protocol theorems | [paper] + [Lean] `Seed/QMulti.lean` |

**Numbers.** Total extraction failure: 2⁻⁶⁰·⁴ at 2³⁰ quantum queries, 2⁻⁴⁰·² at 2⁴⁰, 2⁻²³·³ at 2⁴⁵,
vacuous beyond about 2⁵¹·⁷. Up to about 2⁴¹ the bound is dominated by the q²/2¹²⁸ term that Grover
search makes unavoidable for any 128-bit scheme. Beyond that, the AES binding term (a proof
limitation, not an attack) takes over. Strong simulation-extractability: 2⁻⁶⁰·⁴ at 2³⁰ queries and
2³⁰ simulated proofs.

### 5. The protocols — `docs/security/`

| Note | Main results | Main findings |
|---|---|---|
| `pomfrit.md` | One-more unforgeability (classical: proved; quantum: Q7, under new quantum UOV assumptions). Blindness: **fails on `main`**, proved with the ZK fix. | The paper's reduction has a gap (its first-phase extractor is not well defined for multi-tree VOLEitH), repaired by Lemma P at a 2⁻⁷¹ per-query loss ([Lean] `Protocols/PomFRIT.lean`). A holder can make many valid signatures per message (non-minimal grinding counter): deduplicate on the message. |
| `moussaka.md` | One-more unforgeability, double-spend detection, redemption non-malleability, issuer hiding: proved. | Nullifier squatting (low). The draft's one-more-UOV argument is invalid as written; restructured. |
| `ratatouille.md` | Balance (no inflation), no theft, unlinkability, correctness: proved. | Spends are not bound to a session, so a copied spend request can be redeemed first (medium). |
| `domain-separation.md` | Every hash/XOF/permutation call lies in a disjoint domain, except below. [Lean] `Protocols/DomainSeparation.lean` | PomFRIT's `hash_to_target` overlaps four proof-system domains (no exploit found; fix: a final domain byte). |
| `uov-assumptions.md` | Relates the protocol-specific UOV assumptions to each other and to standard UOV. [Lean] `Protocols/UOVAssumptions.lean` | Several reductions are unavailable; the note states why. |

**Cross-cutting finding (critical, deployment):** PomFRIT's Issuer signs arbitrary targets, and
all protocols share the UOV key type. If one key serves PomFRIT and another protocol, anyone can
mint Ratatouille credits or forge Moussaka tokens (demonstrated). Keys must be separated by
protocol.

### 6. Arithmetization in Lean (in progress) — `VoleMole/Arith/`

Goal: replace the paper proof of L7 with executable Lean models of each relation's constraint
generator, mirroring the C++ call by call, with Lean proofs of

- **completeness**: an honest witness satisfies every constraint;
- **soundness**: if the constraints vanish at any committed values, those values are bits and
  encode a witness, except for a 1/|F| fraction of combination challenges;

and a differential test that evaluates the C++ constraints at random *field-valued* inputs (which
pins down the constraint polynomials, not just their values on bits) and compares with Lean.

| Piece | Status |
|---|---|
| `Arith/Basic.lean`: shared constraint-expression interface | done |
| `Arith/UOV.lean`: UOV public-map gadget (`src/uov/circuit.hpp`) | done: generator, completeness, soundness, 1/\|F\| combination bound |
| `Arith/PomFRIT.lean`: PomFRIT redeem, `P(s) = h ⊕ r` | done: generator, completeness, soundness, end-to-end 1/\|F\| bound |
| `Arith/Keccak/`: Keccak-p[800,12] segmented gadget | in progress (round layers written) |
| `Arith/GF.lean`, `GFEmbedding.lean`: concrete GF(2¹²⁸), GF(256), the embedding | done; embedding proved an injective ring homomorphism in the kernel |
| C++ dumper (`tests/arith/`) and `lake exe arith_vectors` | done; Lean and C++ constraint values agree on every UOV and PomFRIT record, at bit and random field-valued witnesses |
| Moussaka issue/redeem, Ratatouille issue/spend | not started (need the Keccak gadget) |

The UOV gadget's hypothesis, that the embedding GF(256) → GF(2¹²⁸) given by the β constants is an
injective ring homomorphism, is discharged in the kernel for the concrete constants
(`VoleMole.Arith.isEmbedding`). The constants themselves, and the GF(2¹²⁸) and GF(256)
multiplications, are checked against the C++ tables by `arith_vectors`.

To regenerate and check the vectors (the first `lake build arith_vectors` compiles Mathlib to native
code and takes about 10 minutes; `lean/vectors/` is not committed):

```sh
./build/tests/dump_arith_vectors lean/vectors
cd lean && lake build arith_vectors && lake exe arith_vectors
```

## Gaps

What is **not** established, roughly in order of importance:

1. **The probabilistic arguments are not machine-checked.** All random-oracle, ideal-cipher and
   quantum-oracle steps, and all reductions, are paper proofs. Mechanizing the classical ones (e.g.
   with VCVio or EasyCrypt) is possible but a large project; the quantum ones are beyond current
   tools.
2. **Code ↔ model is tested, not proved.** Each Lean model was written by reading the C++ and is
   tied to it by tests in `tests/voleith/test_lean_models.cpp` (and, when finished, the `Arith`
   cross-check). Compiler behaviour, memory safety and constant-time execution are out of scope.
3. **Arithmetization soundness in Lean is incomplete** (§6). Until it is, L7 rests on the paper
   proofs and exhaustive tests. One step there rests on a randomized test: that the public-map
   layout equals pqov's `ov_publicmap` (miss probability below 2⁻²⁰⁰).
4. **Idealized models.** AES-128 is an ideal cipher (classical and quantum), SHAKE and Keccak-p are
   random oracles or random permutations. The Keccak-p[800,12] relations additionally need
   one-wayness/binding assumptions on a 12-round permutation that have little cryptanalysis.
5. **New assumptions.** The protocol proofs use protocol-specific UOV assumptions (one-more
   preimage resistance and variants; chosen-target unforgeability for Moussaka). The quantum
   protocol theorems need quantum-oracle versions of these that are new. Whether standard OMPR
   implies the τ-shift variant used for PomFRIT's tight bound is open.
6. **Quantum bounds stop at about 2⁵¹·⁷ queries.** Going further needs a point-level
   multi-collision lemma for the compressed ideal cipher (M1–M3 in `Q6-cipher-binding.md` §7.3);
   none is known. Parallel quantum queries are not treated.
7. **Zero knowledge on `main` is false**, and the fix is on a branch. The QROM ZK bound is loose
   (2⁻¹⁹ at 2³⁰) until the 256-bit `rho` and salt are added.
8. **Open deployment issues** found by the analysis and not yet fixed in the code: cross-protocol
   key reuse, Ratatouille spend binding, PomFRIT's `hash_to_target` domain byte and signature
   multiplicity, Moussaka nullifier squatting.

Some notes in `docs/` were written at different times and may contain status lines that later
notes superseded (for example, `security/pomfrit.md` lists quantum unforgeability as open, which
`extraction/Q7-qrom-multi-extraction.md` later addressed). Where they disagree, `extraction/README.md`
and this file are the most recent.
